**also can you share a contact number i can hit up whenever i come across an animal in need of help?**"
Television-Sad,2024-04-11 14:49:33,"They don't have the rescue service they claim for, in 2023 we called them around 17 times just to ask for help for an injured calf, but they neither answered nor even checked back.

so please do a ground check before you donate somewhere."
locaterobin,2024-04-11 16:09:21,"We don't make grand claims. our hospital has space for 70 animals, that stays full as it takes long for an animal to heal but they get injured in a minute, so we are on an average able to take in one one rescue a day."
locaterobin,2024-04-11 11:45:44,"Thank you.

our sources of funds are individual donations, very little csr funds, money we get from selling products at [https://shop.peepalfarm.org](https://shop.peepalfarm.org) and then ad revenue on youtube and facebook.

our helpline is 9999429144

sliceshot_,2024-04-11 11:29:51,"Hi robin, love the work you're doing.  
my question is what is the solution to stray dogs problem in india?"
locaterobin,2024-04-11 11:36:04,"Thank you. the problem is two fold.   
  
1. unchecked population of dogs due to state governments mismanaging funds allocated for sterilization programs.    
2.  people not understanding dog behavior and creating problems by being agressive to dogs, and them retaliating.

so the two solutions -

1. support feeders and ngos, so they can together get dogs sterilized ... as feeders are friendly with them, and ngos step in where government fails.  
2. get educated about dog behavior and educate kids about it. example:  [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/v\_pnr52qfja](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/v_pnr52qfja)"

BakrChod,2024-04-11 11:49:37,"&gt;people not understanding dog behavior and creating problems by being agressive to dogs, and them retaliating.


not always. dogs do attack kids or normal passers-by who did not trigger.

also, it is unreasonable if you want us to understand how to behave if a dog is barking or being crazy. the root ~~cause~~ problem is why these animals are out on street, not how people behave. 

dogs, cows, buffaloes etc. do not have a place on street. you put them in jungle or adopt for households or cull them whatever is feasible but street is no place for unsupervised animals."

how did you find your attitude adjustment? what made you look at things differently?"
locaterobin,2024-04-11 16:15:26,"1. when i have the energy, i remind myself that people don't choose to be the way they are - so i don't get as angry.

locaterobin,2024-04-11 11:48:06,"After feeding, start with fostering a case from a nearby resuce. learn first aid. then you can do treat on street. if you volunteer with us (https://peepalfarm.org/join) you'll see that there's a difference between a resuce, a recovery center, a clinic and a shelter. so you can plan what your resources, circumstances and ability allow you to start."

peepal farm relies on donations, product sales, farmstay income and ads on our youtube and facebook videos.

some ""dog lovers"" haven't made the connection, and others don't care. i don't mind if a ""dog lover"" eats meat ... it's better than eating meat and not being a dog lover ... but it's irrational when they feed chicken to dogs they resuce and end up killing so many to save one."

locaterobin,2024-04-11 12:40:00,"Thank you :)

i'd say that if people were do focus on problems that they \_can\_ tackle, instead of ones that have no control on, they will be able to help many more and feel good.

my mantra is

1. do more good (food to hungry, love to love starved strays, put a mat out in winters, water bowl in summers etc)  
2. do less bad (less meat, less eggs, less dairy, less un-necessary consumption etc)  
3. inspire others to do 1, 2 &amp; 3"

locaterobin,2024-04-11 12:10:09,"Oh absolutely. when i started doing this work, it was using just will power ... as i think there is a ""lifestyle withdrwal"" period ... but once that was over, i felt satisfaction like i'd never felt before. so my pursuit of happiness led me to pursuit of purpose, and then eventually made me happy :)"
maachu_diparihai,2024-04-11 11:34:13,"Many say suffering is life and life without suffering would be boring 

what are your thoughts on the same?"
locaterobin,2024-04-11 11:50:07,"Depends on the type of suffering. if the suffering is stemming from physical pain, or needs not met - then boredom is preferable to that type of suffering. beyond, like arthus s. said that people who don't have a worthwhile purpose in life keep going from craving for something (suffering) to then fulfilling the craving and then adapting to it (boredom)."

[deleted],2024-04-11 11:45:47,Hey robin! appreciate the work you are doing. do you think most people today would turn into vegetarian or vegan if they had to catch and kill their own food? there is a lot of data abstraction happening in the meat industry. people as they know meat is bought from the market and into their plates. the social experiment of yours with the goat got me into thinking this. would love to hear your opinion on this.

Equivalent-Row-6734,2024-04-11 12:44:06,"Hi robin

i have worked in the tech industry for a little over 6 years, but my experience has been really horrible so far, especially considering that it is not something i want to do with my life. 

i've resigned from my job and will be completing the notice period in a few weeks, but i'm not sure what i want to do next. i don't want to continue in it though, i'm sure of this.

i guess my question is, how do i find my purpose - what steps do i take? how did you decide you want to run a farm in himachal?

the only thing i want is to not have any regrets on my next decision. i don't want to dread ""monday mornings"" anymore. i want to do something which gives me purpose and meaning. and of course, something which is useful and contributing to society. (basically, want to build a better india, and want to do my part). feel free to dm. would love to take this forward.

so glad you are doing something purposeful now. 
wishing you all the very best in your future."
locaterobin,2024-04-11 16:49:24,"This state can be very freeing, but also paralyzing. you are standing in the rubble of your old life and you can build anything but not knowing where to start is hardest.


i went through a period of trying various things. tried to be a guy who'd live off land, an adventure traveller who will make films, a hippy and finally when i met someone who has nothing and was still good for others, and that not only made me feel ashamed but also rekindled the values my mom had given me but i'd never embraced.


also, i picked reducing physical suffering as a parameter for good, as everyone avoids physical pain...from an earthworm to a dog to a human.

once i decided my purpose is to help reduce pain of those who can't help themselves, it's a matter of picking an issue that tugs at your heartstrings, and something that you can fit in your abilities, resources and circumstances.

locaterobin,2024-04-11 12:04:21,"The way me and family support ourselves is through a business we have in the family. we don't draw salaries from peepal farm. however, people who don't have a source of income and want to run a non profit full time, should draw a little salary to sustain themselves - as long as they disclose it to the donors."
SnooOwls5482,2024-04-11 12:17:11,"Hi robin, nothing specific to ask, except that i have worked closely with you, for some time, and appreciate all the work you are doing. i can testify that many people have moved away from consuming and paying for animal products, majorly because of your work. i have never before, and never since, enjoyed the warmth of being close to goats, chickens and even cows the way i was able to do it at peepal farm. they have beautiful, childlike personalities. and yeah, i hope your work keeps growing exponentially.

i may ask a tangential question - what's your take on other systemic exploitations such as those entrenched in the religious, gender, racial, etc. space? do they also bother you?"
locaterobin,2024-04-11 12:46:47,"Thank you, and this is really interesting that i am responding to someone that i've worked with but don't know who they are as i write :)

i have an information filter ""if i can't help it and it can't help it, i don't want to know it""  ... so that keeps me focused on task at hand. that said, anything that results in physical suffering bothers me. emotionally,  gender based exploitation tugs more at my heartstrings ... for sure more than religion, as you can always choose to change it."

locaterobin,2024-04-11 11:56:09,"1. lets assume that plants do feel pain. when i eat plants directly instead of growing and killing plants to feed animals, and then killing animals - then i cause a lot of plant suffering + animal suffering. if i just directly eat plants, then less plants and 0 animals suffer.

2. we aren't hunting and being part of the natural ecosystem. we are domesticating billions of animals for food in horrible ways. of course, there is plenty suffering in the natural worlds as it is, but humans have added a large un-necessary layer on top.

also, to feed all these domesticated animals, we need way more food than if were to eat plant based. which means way more deforestation than that was needed to feed a plant based population."
SkyOk6659,2024-04-11 11:53:54,"Food is a very personal thing. if you believe you care about the welfare of animals, but still enjoy meat (or consider it a necessity), then maybe you can consider where you source your meat from. not everyone has the means to afford meat from good, ethical farming. but you can limit your consumption instead of bingeing, and being mindful about what you eat.

- books that you would suggest everyone to read.


- do you plan to expand peepal farm's rescue operations and if yes how, and what are the major problems you would face during expansion(except for the finances)?


- what do you see yourself, shivani ma'am and peepal farm after maybe 20-30 years?


- what are the activities that take most of your time?

it's been a lot of time since i've been watching peepal farm actually i have many questions that are much more serious than these and suggestions too but i feel like this or youtube is not the right platform for them, i am planning to visit the farm soon and hopefully getting some time from you to discuss about these things.

so when i say all animals feel pain they ask me if i have a chance to save a human and a dog who i will save answer is obvious human ,now between a dog and a chicken,my answer dog

they say i am a hypocrite that i say all feel pain but priorities more concious one , atleast they aren't hypocrites they openly prioritise one over other and pain of chicken doesn't matter to them

also can you suggest some food combination to fulfill protein requirements cause vegan food doesn't have complete protein,and my parents don't allow whey protein

KayKDee,2024-04-12 08:44:45,"Hello robin, if you're still answering questions - how do you deal with the angst, frustration, negativity that comes with the life you have chosen? most rescuers i know feel helpless they aren't able to save many, or short of funds. many are worn down and not able to continue, but have no choice. you seem to be more in control, even though you may have faced all of these emotions. what is your advice to the other two categories of rescuers?"
locaterobin,2024-04-12 11:27:33,"First off, you get in this work as you have a bleeding heart. but then you have to cut it out and set it aside and make cold decisions. limits are important. being able to say no is important. else, you'll burn out fast.  
  
there are a few things i keep in mind to not get frustrated   
  
0. biggest frustration comes from people. i keep reminding myself that no-one chooses to be annoying.  
1. pick battles i have a shot at. so i'll focus on rocks i can move and not on boulders i can't  
2. i am only one factor among many, so all i can control is doing my bit.  
3. i can't end or even reduce suffering. all i can do is to ensure that it grows slower compared to how it would have grown had i not existed.  
4. this is not a sprint or even a marathon. this is a relay race. the work i am doing is building upon work done by people before me. i just need to take the baton further and hand it over to the next person.  
[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9wbd6oatbm0](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9wbd6oatbm0)  
   
still at times you get impacted and feel like giving up. then i remind myself -  
  
1. no matter how emotionally down i'm feeling, i won't trade places with any of the physically suffering animals we are helping...so i have to keep going.  
2. if i am not doing this, what else is worthwhile to spend time on? especially because my time is not my own. it after all comes at the cost of others ... the ones who have to suffer for my consumption i need to do to survive.   
  
which is why i say, acha kaam karne ke alawa hai bhi kya.

btw, we've covered a lot of this in our film - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_ldsmyileos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ldsmyileos)"

my question is that as a beginner, how can i start an ngo and fund it as animal rescue is cost intensive and connect quality people?

and secondly for a good life, how do we define our purpose like in your case you wanted to reduce suffering but for some people reducing suffering could be a part of life but might not be one's life. in simple words, what are the core principles for finding a purposeful life?"

old ans sick animals because i had the time and money to help them heal, and they healed and i fell in love. i ended up gather 6 pets all foster fails, but the heartache of burying my children is too much and i am not mentally stable to adopt or foster anymore.
